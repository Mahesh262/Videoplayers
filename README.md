# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Sure, here are some notes on what you've implemented in the provided code:

### Videoplayer Component:

1. **State Management**:
   - Utilizes React's `useState` hook to manage state variables.
   - `data`: Manages an array of video data.
   - `selectedVideo`: Keeps track of the currently selected video.
   
2. **Routing**:
   - Uses `useParams` from React Router DOM to extract the `id` parameter from the URL.
   - Determines the selected video based on the `id` parameter.
   - Navigates between videos using the `useNavigate` hook.

3. **Lifecycle Management**:
   - Utilizes `useEffect` to handle updates when the `data` or `id` changes.
   - When the component mounts or `data`/`id` changes, it updates the selected video accordingly.

4. **Video Player Interaction**:
   - Utilizes `react-youtube` library to embed and play YouTube videos.
   - Handles video playback using the `YouTube` component and its callbacks.
   - Utilizes `useRef` to access the YouTube player instance and control playback (play/pause).
   - Implements swipe gestures for navigation using `react-swipeable`.

### App Component:

1. **Routing**:
   - Utilizes `Routes` and `Route` components from React Router DOM to manage navigation within the app.
   - Defines routes for the Video List and Video Player components.

2. **Components Integration**:
   - Integrates the `VideoList` and `Videoplayer` components within the routing structure.
   - Renders the appropriate component based on the current route.

3. **Commented-Out Code**:
   - Contains a commented-out `ReactPlayer` component, which suggests a different approach to video playback that isn't currently being used.

Overall, the application seems to provide a video player interface that allows users to navigate between different videos, play/pause them, and swipe left/right to move between videos. It also includes routing logic to switch between the video list and individual video playback screens.
